# **Introduction to Firebase**
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas). It provides developers with a variety of tools and services to help them develop quality apps, grow their user base, and earn profit. It is built on Googleâ€™s infrastructure.
It is categorized as a NoSQL database program, which stores data in JSON-like documents.
Developers relying on this platform get access to services that they would have to develop themselves, and it enables them to lay focus on delivering robust application experiences.

### What type of apps can be developed?
* Android
* iOS
* Web

Here is a good article on Firebase - [Medium](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/what-is-firebase-the-complete-story-abridged-bcc730c5f2c0)

## **Key Features**

#### 1. Authentication
Authentication is basically the registration, sign in and user verification part of the app.
Firebase Authentication provides backend services to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

#### 2. Realtime Database
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected user. When you build cross-platform apps with our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all the users share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.

#### 3. Hosting
Firebase Hosting allows fast and secure hosting for our web application, static and dynamic content, and microservices. It is production-grade web content hosting for the developers. We can easily and quickly deploy web apps and serve both static and dynamic content.

#### 4. Storage
Cloud Storage for Firebase lets you upload and share user generated content, such as images and video, which allows you to build rich media content into your apps. Your data is stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Cloud Storage for Firebase lets you securely upload these files directly from mobile devices and web browsers.
