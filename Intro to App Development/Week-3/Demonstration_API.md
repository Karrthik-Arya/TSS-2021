# Demonstration App

Hii Guys,

Since now you all know what an API is and what is it used for, you can finally make an App using flutter which fetches data from an API.
Fetching data from the internet is necessary for most apps. Luckily, Dart and Flutter provide tools, such as the http package, for this type of work.

This recipe uses the following steps:

1. Add the http package.
2. Make a network request using the http package.
3. Convert the response into a custom Dart object.
4. Fetch and display the data with Flutter.

Some common apps which require the fetching of data are Weather Report app, News App and World Clock App etc.

For the demonstration purpose we'll be making a World Clock App using the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WghpP9W2vXo&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=22&ab_channel=TheNetNinja) playlist.
For this week you'll have to watch videos from 22 to 35. Watch these videos very carefully as they are very important for learning how to fetch the data from an API!

## Note
It's very much possible that the package that you use might be deprecated, in that case look for other similar packages on flutter's website. You may DM the course moderators if you face any such issue.
In case you have any doubts in API or the implementation of the packages used, feel free to discuss in the telegram group. 

Happy Learning:)
