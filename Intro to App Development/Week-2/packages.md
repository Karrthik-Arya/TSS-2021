# Using packages
## Introduction
Let's say you are making an app.
It is very likely that you will need to use code made by others.
In other words you will use external packages.

In a Flutter project, you can use external packages by editing the `pubspec.yaml` file.
You can use any package in your app which is listed on https://pub.dev/

## Tutorial
Follow the tutorial from [this codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1#0).
The associated video for the codelab is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6KZ3cTGBWw).

If you would like to try the app first, run the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/vedk/flutter_package_try.git
```
Then open the project in Android Studio.
You will see a pop up on the right bottom corner.
It will ask you to run `flutter pub get`.
Click the "pub get" link on the pop up.
Android Studio will download and setup the packages.
You can then run the app.
