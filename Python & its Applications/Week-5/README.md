# Welcome to Week-5 of Learner's Space
We have almost reached the end of the course. This is the last week. By now you would have got an overview of Python and seen 3 interesting applications of it
while learning about many different libraries. One important skill you should have developed by now is the ability to learn about new libraries using the 
documentation or any other resource. 

This week you can choose whatever topics you find interesting from those given below. Many of them are extensions of what you have learnt earlier.

## Scipy for Scientific Computing

SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data. With SciPy, an interactive Python session becomes a data-processing and system-prototyping environment rivaling systems, such as MATLAB, IDL, Octave, R-Lab, and SciLab.

The additional benefit of basing SciPy on Python is that this also makes a powerful programming language available for use in developing sophisticated programs and specialized applications. Scientific applications using SciPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of the software landscape by developers across the world. Everything from parallel programming to web and data-base subroutines and classes have been made available to the Python programmer. All of this power is available in addition to the mathematical libraries in SciPy.

You can head on to this [link](https://www.edureka.co/blog/scipy-tutorial/) for an introduction to SciPy. Another reference for a more comprehensive overview is provided [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scipy/scipy_quick_guide.htm). It includes the implementations of the varied subpackages.

## Web Scraping with Selenium

Selenium is a framework which allows us to interact with the HTML elements of a website. So till now, we were only extracting data from a HTML webpage and then using it for different tasks. In addition to extracting data, Selenium allows us to interact with the webpage as well. So any interaction that you perform with a webpage can be automated using Selenium, for eg: Filling a form online, reading and extracting elements of the source code, etc. Now we will only be covering the basic of Selenium here, since Selenium in itself requires another course for learning.

You can checkout this YouTube playlist on Introduction to Selenium - [Selenium Tutorials Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-n40rB1XaJ0ak1bemvlqumQ).

Optionally, you can also checkout this link for reading tutorials - [Selenium WebDriver Tutorials](https://www.guru99.com/selenium-tutorial.html). This link also covers advanced tutorials on selenium webdrivers, so if you want to explore more of Selenium, you can go through them.

## GUI Development using TKinter
Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface.

Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps âˆ’

1. Import the Tkinter module.

2. Create the GUI application main window.

3. Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.

4. Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

5. Head over to this [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tkinter-tutorial/) to learn more about tkinter. You can also refer [this](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tkinter) for a comprehensive overview of all UI widgets.

For those prefering video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMP1oQOxfM0) is a good source to refer to.
