# Welcome to Week-5 of Learner's Space
We have almost reached the end of the course. This is the last week. By now you would have got an overview of Python and seen 3 interesting applications of it
while learning about many different libraries. One important skill you should have developed by now is the ability to learn about new libraries using the 
documentation or any other resource. 

This week you can choose whatever topics you find interesting from those given below. Many of them are extensions of what you have learnt earlier.
